        maybe try to follow the implementation of sltatus for ram statistics?
        looks interesting.

    is free's percentage calculated from total? should it be if it is?
    what about cached? maybe add a percentage for that too, calculated
    from total?

    in combined section, ac. used does not have percentage

block
    make sectors count * 512?
    more research is needed about this.
